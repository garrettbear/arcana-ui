## Live Playground

The Arcana UI playground is a live interactive environment where you can explore all 22 components, experiment with props, preview the design token system, and test dark mode.

**[Open the Playground →](http://localhost:5173)**

> The playground runs locally. Start it with:
>
> ```bash
> cd playground
> pnpm dev
> ```

## What's in the playground

### Component gallery

Browse all 22 components with live props controls:

- Toggle variants, sizes, and states
- See accessibility attributes in the DOM inspector
- Copy example code

### Typography system

Preview the full Arcana type scale — headings, body, captions, monospace — applied to real content blocks.

### Spacing editor

Visual spacing reference with all `--arcana-spacing-*` tokens laid out side by side.

### Token inspector

Browse every CSS custom property in the design system, with live previews of colour swatches, shadows, and radii.

### Dark mode toggle

Switch between light and dark themes to preview every component in both modes simultaneously.

## Building for production

The playground uses Vite and can be built as a static site:

```bash
cd playground
pnpm build
```

Output goes to `playground/dist/`. Deploy to any static host (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages).
