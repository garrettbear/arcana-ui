## What is Arcana UI?

Arcana UI is a modern React component library designed for speed, accessibility, and AI-first workflows. It ships 22 production-ready components built on top of a carefully crafted warm stone/indigo design token system.

Every component is:

- **Accessible by default** — WCAG AA contrast, keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, axe-core tested
- **Themeable** — all visual properties exposed as CSS custom properties
- **Zero-dependency runtime** — CSS Modules, no CSS-in-JS, tree-shakeable ESM
- **AI-readable** — ships with `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` so AI assistants can use the API

## Why Arcana UI?

Most component libraries ask you to choose between beauty and accessibility, or between flexibility and consistency. Arcana solves this by:

1. **Starting with tokens** — every colour, spacing value, and radius comes from a semantic token layer that you can override without touching components
2. **Composing, not wrapping** — components accept `className` and forward all native HTML attributes, so you never fight the library
3. **Thinking AI-first** — the `llms.txt` manifest means an AI coding assistant can generate correct Arcana code from a prompt alone

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
npm install @arcana-ui/core @arcana-ui/tokens
# or
pnpm add @arcana-ui/core @arcana-ui/tokens
```

### 2. Import the design tokens CSS

In your app entry point (e.g. `main.tsx` or `_app.tsx`):

```tsx
import '@arcana-ui/tokens/dist/arcana.css'
```

### 3. Use components

```tsx
import { Button, Input, Modal } from '@arcana-ui/core'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button variant="primary">Get started</Button>
      <Input label="Email" placeholder="you@example.com" />
    </div>
  )
}
```

That's it. No providers required for most components.
